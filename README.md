# TailGAN-Crypto-Dissertation
MSc Dissertation project on generating synthetic cryptocurrency return series using Tail-GAN and Conditional GAN, with a focus on Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), skewness, and kurtosis alignment.

This repository contains the implementation of **Tail-GAN** and **Conditional GAN (C-GAN)** models used in my MSc Dissertation at The University of Sheffield.  
The aim of the project is to generate **synthetic cryptocurrency return sequences** that preserve **tail risk metrics** such as Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), skewness, and kurtosis.
